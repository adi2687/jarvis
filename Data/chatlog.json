According to his devotees and followers, Sai Baba's powers and blessings are believed to be limitless and boundless. He is revered as a spiritual master, a yogi, and a miracle worker who could perform miracles and help his devotees in various ways.\nHowever, it is also believed that Sai Baba's teachings and powers are not limited to material or worldly success, but rather focus on spiritual growth, self-realization, and the attainment of inner peace and liberation. His teachings emphasize the importance of self-control, detachment, and surrender to the divine will.\nIn this sense, the limitations are not in Sai Baba's powers, but in our own understanding, faith, and willingness to surrender to the divine. His teachings are meant to guide us towards a life of spiritual growth, love, and service to others, and to help us recognize the true nature of the self and the universe."

The error message you're seeing is quite common.\nThe error code \"429\" is an HTTP status code that indicates that the request has been rejected because the user has exceeded the allowed number of requests within a certain time frame. This is often referred to as \"rate limiting\" or \"quota exhaustion\".\nIn other words, you've reached the maximum number of requests allowed within a certain time period, and the server is temporarily blocking your requests to prevent abuse and ensure the service remains available to others.\nTo resolve this error, you can try the following:\n1. Wait for some time before making the request again.\n2. Reduce the frequency of requests to avoid exceeding the rate limit.\n3. Check if there are any restrictions or quotas on the number of requests you can make within a certain time frame.\nThis error is not specific to our conversation, but rather a general error that can occur when interacting with online services."

This is the simplest approach, as the error is often temporary and will resolve itself after a short period.\n2. **Implement rate limiting**: If you're making requests programmatically, implement rate limiting in your code to ensure you're not exceeding the allowed number of requests within a certain time frame.\n3. **Use caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the number of requests made to the server. This can help minimize the likelihood of hitting rate limits.\n4. **Optimize requests**: Optimize your requests to reduce the load on the server. This can include reducing the frequency of requests, combining multiple requests into a single request, or using more efficient APIs.\n5. **Contact the service provider**: If you're consistently hitting rate limits and can't optimize your requests further, contact the service provider to discuss possible solutions, such as increasing your quota or implementing custom rate limiting.\nRemember, it's essential to respect the rate limits and quotas imposed by service providers to ensure the service remains available and responsive to all users.\nNow, let's move forward and tackle the next challenge, Aditya!"
